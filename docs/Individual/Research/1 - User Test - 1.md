| **Test purpose：** <br/>- Test concept acceptance<br/>- Whether the user has doubts about the interaction when using it.                                                                                                   |

**Feedback - 01:
**

Feedback for implementation:

- Onboarding Process:

  - Users questioned the necessity of the introduction screen.
  - Some users had difficulty locating the button on the start screen.

- Bikes Pages:

  - The filter button was found to be confusing, with users unsure about the selected and unselected options.
  - Users were unsure about the search bar's functionality and whether it was necessary.
  - Suggestion to hide the search bar on the first screen using a specific technique.

- Bikes Profile:

  - Users found it challenging to locate the button to navigate to the next page. It was suggested to change the button color for better visibility.
    The layout of the page did not conform to smaller mobile screens.

- Navigation Page:

  - Some users did not notice the presence of a QR scanner button at the bottom of the screen.
  - Overview of Design:
  - Users recommended exploring discoverable design principles to enhance and refine the overall design.

**Conclusions:**  
During the first round of technical user testing, most users easily understood and accepted the concept. However, some expressed interest in the charging mode (how users pay for the rent) and raised questions regarding management issues. These concerns include uniform management of bicycles, registration processes, and whether donors are free to leave their bikes on the side of the road.

When initially designing and conceptualizing the idea, I had already taken these issues into consideration. However, the users' feedback has reignited my thoughts on these topics, and I have some new ideas to explore.

Given the limited time available, I plan to prioritize refining the existing technical details based on user feedback. Once the next round of user testing is completed, I will evaluate the scope and feasibility of delving deeper into these concept topics, including the charging mode and management issues.
