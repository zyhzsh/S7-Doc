# Lotus blossom - mentally shift - "ownership"

#### Context

My current idea is to build a concept similar to "bookcrossing" but for bikes.

#### Design challenge

To find a solution that will help users shift their mental model from "buy/rent" to "ownership" or a sense of obligation to cherish the property.

The onwnership in this context,it refers to the sense of responsibility that users feel towards the bikes they use.
Instead of treating the bikes as disposable or temporary, users should feel a sense of ownership towards them, as if they are their own personal property.

#### Outcome
