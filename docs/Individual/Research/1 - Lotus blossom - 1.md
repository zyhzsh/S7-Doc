# Lotus blossom - mentally shift - "ownership"

#### Context

My current idea is to build a concept similar to "bookcrossing" but for bikes.

#### Design challenge

To find a solution that will help users shift their mental model from "buy/rent" to "ownership" or a sense of obligation to cherish the property.

The onwnership in this context,it refers to the sense of responsibility that users feel towards the bikes they use.
Instead of treating the bikes as disposable or temporary, users should feel a sense of ownership towards them, as if they are their own personal property.

- Some idea for building the whole process of the application

idea - 1: Registration
Users can register on the platform to become members and access the bike-sharing service. The registration process will collect user information and create a user profile.

idea - 2: Bike Availability:
The bike-sharing platform will work with bike suppliers to have a pool of bikes available for rent. Bike owners can also choose to register their unused bikes on the platform for renting purposes.

idea - 3: Bike Selection
The platform will offer a range of bikes for users to choose from based on their personal preferences, needs, and bike availability. Users can select a bike and make a reservation using the platform.

idea - 4: Pick-up
Users can pick up the bike from a designated location using a code provided by the platform. They will then use the bike as they need for the rental period.

idea - 5: Return
Users will return the bike to a designated location at the end of the rental period. They will need to check the bike's condition and confirm its return status through the platform.

idea - 6: Maintenance

The bike-sharing platform will offer incentives for users to maintain the bikes in good condition. Users can report any issues they encounter with the bike during the rental period, and the platform will arrange for maintenance or repairs as necessary.

idea - 7: Ownership Awareness
The bike-sharing platform will use gamification, personalization, peer-to-peer accountability, public recognition, community involvement, feedback, and education to encourage a sense of ownership and responsibility among users. Users can participate in community events, share their bike usage stories, and receive rewards for proper bike usage and maintenance.

### Summary

The process for using the bike-sharing application begins with individuals who own bikes that they are not using, leaving them at designated locations. Bike suppliers can also contribute their own bikes to be rented out. Each bike is given a unique ID that allows for personalization and attachment to the bike's history. Users can browse the available bikes on the app and select one that suits their needs.

To incentivize proper maintenance and encourage a sense of ownership, users are given rewards for taking care of the bikes they rent. These rewards can range from discounts on future rentals to public recognition within the community.

In order to foster a sense of community and peer-to-peer accountability, the app also includes a self-monitoring mechanism. Users are encouraged to report any damage or misuse of bikes they come across, and those who report issues are rewarded. Additionally, community events and challenges are held to promote healthy competition and engagement.

The app also includes educational features such as a knowledge base of biking tips and resources, and users can receive personalized recommendations based on their interests and previous rentals.

One example of a use case for the bike-sharing app is for tourists visiting a new city. They can quickly and easily rent a bike, customized to their preferences and needs, to explore the city at their leisure. The app provides recommendations for bike-friendly routes and sights, as well as tips for safely navigating the city's streets.
