# Mash Up: Mentallty shfiting

## Context:

I am currently in the process of conceptualizing a shared mobility application with the objective of enhancing ownership awareness among users and reducing misuse. During my last sprint, I conducted research and identified the need for mental shifting on the user side. In order to help users embrace ownership, I came up with several ideas such as characterizing the property, making it unique from the user's perspective by adding unique traits like color, history, among others. Additionally, I proposed a self-monitoring mechanism like a deposit system, community building, and adding check status mechanisms during the rent/return process to reduce abuse.

## Outcome:

## Conclusion & Next:

With the help of ChatGPT, I did inspire by the answer above.
Combine with the feedback from the teacher form last week.
I have narrowed my focus to bike-sharing as the specific case for my project. My current idea is to build a concept similar to "bookcrossing" but for bikes. To focus more on "ownership," I will temporarily set aside the common problems of shared bikes like illegal parking or inconvenience compared to privately-owned bicycles. My aim is to find a solution that will help users shift their mental model from "buy/rent" to "ownership" or a sense of obligation to cherish the property.
