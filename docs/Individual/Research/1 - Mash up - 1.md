# Mash Up: Mentallty shfiting - Idea Pitch

## Context:

Currently, I am in the midst of conceptualizing a shared mobility application that aims to increase user ownership awareness and mitigate misuse. In my latest sprint, I conducted research and discovered that a mental shift is required on the user's end to encourage ownership. To help with this "shift", I developed a range of ideas, including the characterization of property by incorporating unique traits like color and history from the user's perspective. Furthermore, I suggested implementing a self-monitoring mechanism such as a deposit system, building a sense of community, and introducing check status mechanisms during the rent/return process to deter abusive behavior.

## Outcome:

## Conclusion & Next:

With the help of ChatGPT and feedback from my teacher last week, I have decided to narrow my focus to bike-sharing for my project. Specifically, I am developing a concept similar to "bookcrossing" but for bikes. In order to emphasize the concept of "ownership," I will temporarily set aside common issues associated with shared bikes such as illegal parking or inconvenience compared to privately-owned bicycles. My objective is to identify a solution that will facilitate a mental shift in users from "buy/rent" to "ownership" or a sense of responsibility towards the property.
