# Concept refinement v0.2

## Conext

After the first round of [<u>user testing</u>](/docs/Individual/Research/1%20-%20User%20Test%20-%201.md#test---01), their feedback not only provided some insights into technical implementation and UI design details but also sparked some ideas that I hadn't thoroughly considered in the initial design concept due to time constraints.

However, given the limited time available, I intend to prioritize refining the existing technical details before exploring and validating these new ideas. Therefore, the following content is solely for recording purposes. It will be revisited and further explored based on the outcome and scope of the next round of user testing.

####

**Q1: If I don't have any unused bicycles or don't donate a bicycle, how can I earn points?**  
A1: Users can acquire points through online payments.

**Q2: I noticed a star next to the points on the user's avatar. What is its purpose?**  
A2: Currently, the star is just a placeholder, but it represents an achievement/badge system in a deeper sense. The system tracks the points users have spent, which to some extent demonstrates their contribution to resource reuse.

**Q3: How are the placement and management of bicycles addressed?**  
A3: Currently, I have two ideas for this:

- Users can register online through the system and generate a QR code, which they can print and attach to the bicycles. They can then freely place the bicycles in any location. This approach offers convenience but introduces uncertainties and challenges in verifying the authenticity of user registration data.

- Collaboration with local bicycle repair shops or stores can be established, where users need to return and register the bicycles at designated merchants. This approach not only increases potential customer flow to repair bicycles but also ensures the accuracy of platform data.

**Q4: I noticed that each bicycle has a cool name, picture, and category. In real-world scenarios, user-provided pictures may not be of high quality, and the names may not be appealing. How did you consider this issue?**  
A4: We can leverage AI to assist with this. AI can help enhance and modify text and images based on user descriptions or donor preferences, ensuring a better representation of the bicycles. Additionally, AI can provide assistance during the categorization process.

**Q5: What principle is used for searching the bicycle listings, and why was it designed this way?**  
A5: Currently, the bicycles are presented based on the user's location, with the closest bicycles appearing first in the list. Users can also quickly find their desired type of bicycle by selecting a specific category. Although I have considered more novel approaches for fun, such as a "tinder" style, it would compromise usability. Therefore, I opted for a relatively traditional method.

**Q6: I noticed some icons below the bike profiles, but I'm not clear on their meaning. Could you explain them?**  
A6: Each icon represents an interaction event between the user and the bicycle. These events add richness and diversity to the bicycle's usage history.
