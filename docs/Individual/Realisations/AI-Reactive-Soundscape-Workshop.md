# Reactive Soundscape - AI Logo maker

## Context

I recently had a random idea to create a good logo for both my group and individual projects. With the help of AI, I can quickly and easily generate logos in the early stages of my projects. This will allow me to visualize and conceptualize the branding for my projects, and make any necessary changes before the project is complete.
