# BikeCrossing MVP

## Context

Based on my previous requirements for the application, there are still some missing functionalities that need to be addressed, specifically the bike profile and the point mini-quest system. In the following section, I will provide a draft and evidence to showcase the implementation of these features and present my proof-of-concept (POC) product.
