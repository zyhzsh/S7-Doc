# DocScanner - Concept

## Context

The idea came from my daily observations.

As an immigrant, we often receive local letters. Due to the language barrier, when we want to process these documents without losing important information, we often take out our phones or computers to look up unfamiliar words one by one and translate the entire paragraph. Even though we can quickly translate by copying and pasting, the whole process is still very cumbersome and time-consuming. Moreover, the translation sometimes is not accurate, making it difficult to verify our understanding of the entire letter.

Therefore, I came up with the idea of using GPT to develop software that generates document translations and summaries based on the user's preferred language.

## Possible scenarios

Scenario 1: Simplified Translation Process
User Story: Maria, a young immigrant living in the Netherlands, just received a letter from her landlord written in Dutch. As she is not fluent in the language yet, she feels overwhelmed by the task of translating the entire letter. She remembers using an app specifically designed for this purpose. She takes out her smartphone and opens the app while sitting at her kitchen table. She clicks on the camera icon within the app and takes a clear photo of the letter. The app's intelligent scanning technology quickly detects the text and extracts it. Maria selects her preferred language, English, from the language options provided. With a simple tap on the "Translate" button, the app starts processing the text and generates an accurate translation of the entire letter. Maria can now comfortably read and understand the content, ensuring she doesn't miss any important information.

Scenario 2: Summary Generation for Quick Understanding
User Story: Ahmed, an immigrant working as a freelance designer, receives a contract agreement from a local client. The document is lengthy and filled with legal terms that he finds difficult to comprehend. He needs to quickly grasp the main points and ensure he agrees with the terms. Ahmed opens the app on his laptop and uploads the document from his email. He selects his preferred language, French, and clicks on the "Summarize" button. The app's powerful language processing algorithms analyze the content and generate a concise summary highlighting the key clauses and essential information. Ahmed skims through the summary, easily identifying the critical points of the contract. With this quick overview, he gains a solid understanding of the terms and can confidently proceed with his work.

Scenario 3: Language Customization and Verification
User Story: Sophie, an international student studying in the Netherlands, receives a notification on her phone that she has received a letter from the university's administration. As the letter is in Dutch, a language she's been learning but is not yet fluent in, she wants to ensure she fully comprehends the content. Sophie opens the app while sitting in her dorm room, and she uploads the scanned PDF of the letter. She selects her preferred language, Spanish, and taps the "Translate" button. The app quickly generates a translated version of the letter, presenting it in a clean and readable format. While reading through the translation, Sophie notices a specific phrase related to her tuition fees that she wants to verify for complete accuracy. She highlights the phrase and taps the "Verify" button. The app provides alternative translations and even offers an audio pronunciation for each option. Sophie carefully compares the alternatives, listens to their pronunciations, and selects the translation that she feels most confident about. With the app's verification feature, she can now trust her understanding of the letter's content and proceed with the necessary actions.

## MVP requirements:

- This software should be able to extract text information in a quick and efficient manner, and users should be able to make corresponding adjustments to the extracted text.
- Users should be able to select their preferred translation language.
- Users should be able to view the translated results and summary information of the document.
- Users should be able to access the history of document information.
- (Optional) users should be able to import their email/pdf/image files into the app to analyze.
