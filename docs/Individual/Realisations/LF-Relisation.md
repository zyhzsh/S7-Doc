# Figma prototype design - v0.2

## Context

Over time, my personal project concept has gradually become clearer. The current design challenge is to approach it from a holistic perspective, combining all previous concepts and presenting the overall concept and basic elements of my personal project in the form of figma.

The main concept revolves around "bike crossing" and "ownership," and to emphasize this element, I introduced the concept of "bike profile." This means that users can access the "life trajectory" of the bike after donating or borrowing it.

The supporting elements include

- point system
- donation/rent/return process
- bike profile
- mini quest system (reword point)
- badget system

#### Concept - 1 Type of bike

As renters of bicycles, users have different needs and purposes. They may not require a bicycle regularly but require one in certain situations, such as:

- Individuals on a family trip who want to explore the surrounding area.
- People planning a long-distance Bike road trip who do not have road bikes.
- Freshmen who want to borrow a bike temporarily to meet their grocery shopping needs.
- Business travelers staying in hotels who want to tour the surrounding environment.
- People who enjoy trying out certain types of self-washing cars but do not want to purchase one.

#### Concept - 2 Bike profile

The introduction of a "bike profile" can trigger the Alfred Effect and co-creation in the Octalysis framework. As renters of bicycles interact with the mini-quest and become involved in the construction of the bike's story, they will unconsciously develop a stronger attachment to the bike and cherish it more.

#### Concept - 3 Rent/Return Process

The services provided by our platform differ from those of platforms that offer one-time rentals.

Our target users typically plan their rentals in advance, such as renting for a day, two days, or a week, rather than renting by the hour or minute. As a result, the demand for bicycle storage distribution points is reduced. This provides a new business cooperation model with bicycle retailers and repair shops located throughout the city.

Users can earn points by completing maintenance activities, such as tire replacements, which can be used to rent bicycles in the future. Repair shops provide drop-off locations for the platform, while also increasing revenue by selling accessories and repair services.

#### Concept - 4 Mini quest

Introducing mini quests can bring multiple benefits:

- By completing simple maintenance tasks such as cleaning and lubricating, users can effectively extend the lifespan of the bike.
- Users can earn rewards or credits by completing mini tasks, which can be used for future bike rentals. As users complete these tasks, they will unconsciously develop a stronger attachment to the bike they have rented.
- These mini tasks can enrich the bike's profile. Past bike renters will feel that they have participated in a meaningful activity when they review this information.

  Currently, the mini quests you have designed can be roughly divided into several categories (which may be updated in the future based on needs):

#### Concept - 5 Badget/Achievements system

The system has not been fully implemented in the design yet, but the basic concept and idea is to increase user stickiness by introducing an achievement badge system. For example, different levels of badges can be awarded based on the number of points a user has earned through platform activities.

Another idea is to award badges for bikes that have been rented and returned in good condition, or for bikes that have traveled a certain distance. According to research, a well-maintained bike can last for decades. This can be used as a selling point to award badges and further encourage users to cherish and take care of the bikes they rent.

#### Concept - 6 Future and imagination

These are some interesting scenarios to imagine:

- Imagine a userA, who donated his bike in country C. Several years later, his son travels to country D and happens to rent the same bike that A had donated on the platform. What a fascinating coincidence that would be!

- Fast forward several years into the future, due to the revolution in battery technology, human-powered bicycles have become outdated and are no longer popular or widely used. However, the bike that was released into the "drift" years ago is still out there, surviving through time.
