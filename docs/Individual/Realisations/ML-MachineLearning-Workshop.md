## Context

to binding with my individual project, I'm going to trained a model for classifying the types of the bike.
This can be applied when the the user wants to register their bike to the system.

In this model it divides in five categories:

- Road bike
- Touring bike
- Cruiser bike
- Mountain bike
- Special bike
