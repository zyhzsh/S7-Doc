# Gamification

## Context

Followed the Octalysis framework here are some of the examples idea bind with my individual project concepts.

- Epic meaning
  - Co-creationist
    - By finishing the quest to “Create” memory with the Bike
  - Free to borrow
    - By donating your bike, get some ” points” and rent your bike anywhere around the world.
- Ownership & Possession
  - Points
  - Collection sets
  - Alfred effect
    - By donating their bike, the user can still track the “life path” of their bike.
    - After returning the bike, the user will become the “history owner” of the bike and be able to track the “life path.”
- Unpredictability
  - MiniQuests (point reward)
    - Finishing your randomly assigned quest to get the reward point. The quest can be a “maintenance quest, memory sharing quest.” It will help to build the “life story” of the bike.

### Summary

After sharing my ideas with Marcel, he expressed agreement and interest in seeing more tangible progress. As a result, my next course of action is to develop a prototype for the project's UI/UX design.
