## Context

Followed the Octalysis framework here are some of the examples idea bind with my individual project concepts.

- Epic meaning
  - Co-creationist
    - By completing a quest to "Create" a memory with your bike, you can unlock a sense of accomplishment and purpose.
  - Free to borrow
    - By donating your idle bike, you can earn points that can be used to rent bikes anywhere in the world. This creates a sense of contribution and ownership in a global community.
- Ownership & Possession
  - Points
    - Using a virtual economy ecosystem, users can earn and spend points to personalize their biking experience. This adds a sense of ownership and control.
  - Alfred effect
    - By donating their bike, users can still track its "life path" and feel a sense of attachment and legacy. After returning the bike, users become the "history owner" of the bike and can continue to track its journey.
- Unpredictability
  - MiniQuests (point reward)
    - Completing randomly assigned quests, such as maintenance or memory sharing, can earn users points and help build the story of their bike. This adds an element of surprise and unpredictability to the experience.
