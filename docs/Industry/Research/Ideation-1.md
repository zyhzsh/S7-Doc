# Ideation - Challenges & Community

## Context

At present, we have a low-fidelity prototype and intend to move forward with its design. We recognize that there may be a need to further integrate the community aspect based on client feedback, in order to improve user engagement.

## Concept

The "challenge" is a series of training tasks that users can complete to unlock content associated with it. Completion of sub-tasks or checkpoints enables users to access certain parts of the challenge. During breaks, users can browse the interesting material available to them.

To encourage users to continue with the challenges, a "reading/watching period" can be included as a hidden mechanism, such as a 5-minute video or 400-word article. Once users finish these breaks, they are reminded to continue with the challenges. The rest of the content can also motivate users to complete tasks and checkpoints.

Upon completing a challenge, users gain access to all the associated content and can also unlock the comment section of the challenge. This feature allows users to interact and share their experiences with others who have completed the same challenge.

The content could be

- Education content:
  - History of bouldering
  - Preparation tips
- The famous “Rock“
  - Who conquered this “Rock“ (Ascents records)
  - Video, journal, Blog, Pictures
  - History of the “Rock“
  - Etc.
- Some fun-facts
- Story of Challenge a Difficult “Rock”
- Community experience sharing
