# Test concepts with Persona (Alex)

## Context

The goal is that we want to arouse users' interest during their training time instead of just delivering training content. Therefore, we would like to introduce storytelling for each challenge to engage users.

We have divided ourselves into three groups to brainstorm different concepts/ideas for utilizing storytelling in relation to training slopers (a climbing training application).

## Our concepts

Utilizing Storytelling with Hangboarding Buddy - @de echte dimitri @Raf Schapendonk

HangOn: Personalized Hangboarding Journey - @Bachynskyy,Nazar N.S. @Mirela-Cristiana Gherlan

The Ascent: Your Journey To The Peak - @ShengHangZhu @Danev,Stan S.V.

## Results

- Utilizing Storytelling with Hangboarding Buddy:

  This concept focuses on integrating storytelling elements with a hangboarding buddy feature. It allows users to select a buddy, either a real-time demonstration from experienced climbers or their own past performances, to motivate and track progress.

  - Pros: The hangboarding buddy feature adds a personal touch, and the customizable environment enhances the user's immersion in the training experience.
  - Cons: The concept doesn't provide as much detail about the specific storytelling elements or how they will be integrated into the training sessions.

- HangOn: Personalized Hangboarding Journey:

  This concept highlights personalized features and storytelling elements to enhance the hangboarding experience. Users follow the journey of a local gym member, from their motivation to climb to reaching their goal.

  - Pros: The concept incorporates relatability through a local gym member's story and provides clear chapters with relevant information and motivational messages.
  - Cons: It could benefit from more interactive elements and visual representation of progress to keep users engaged throughout their training.

- The Ascent: Your Journey To The Peak:

  This concept presents a storytelling concept for climbing app training sessions, with a seven-chapter structure that corresponds to sets in the workout. Each chapter showcases users' progress, challenges, and a sense of community.

  - Pros: The concept provides a detailed breakdown of each chapter and how it relates to the user's climbing journey. The use of animations, voiceover narration, and performance tracking adds depth and motivation.
  - Cons: The concept could further explore interactive elements to keep users engaged and provide a visual representation of progress throughout the training session.

Of the three concepts, "The Ascent: Your Journey To The Peak" stands out as it provides a clear structure, engaging storytelling elements, and motivational aspects that closely align with Alex's preferences and goals. The concept combines animations, voiceover narration, performance tracking, community engagement, and celebratory animations to create an immersive and motivating workout experience.
